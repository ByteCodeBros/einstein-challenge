# Genetic Algorithm Solution for Einstein's Challenge

## Introduction
This repository contains an implementation of a **genetic algorithm (GA)**, a **metaheuristic** inspired by the process of **natural selection**. It is part of the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA) and is designed to solve optimization and search problems through operations such as **mutation, crossover, and selection**.

## Implementation
The genetic algorithm in this repository has been specifically implemented to solve **Einstein's Challenge**, a logic puzzle that involves deducing the correct arrangement of various items based on a series of clues. The challenge is structured as follows:

- There are five houses in a row, each of a different color.
- In each house lives a person of a different nationality.
- Each of the five owners drinks a different type of beverage, smokes a different brand of cigar, and keeps a different pet.
- No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage.

The objective is to determine who owns the fish based on the given clues, which include statements like "The Brit lives in the red house," "The Swede keeps dogs as pets," and "The Dane drinks tea."

The genetic algorithm approaches this problem by representing each possible solution as an individual in the population. The fitness function evaluates how closely an individual's arrangement of houses, nationalities, beverages, cigars, and pets matches the clues provided. Through the processes of **selection, crossover, and mutation**, the algorithm iteratively improves the population until it **converges on the correct solution**.

## How the Genetic Algorithm Works
The algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**: Start with a randomly generated population of candidate solutions for Einstein's Challenge.
2. **Evaluation**: Each candidate is evaluated based on how well it satisfies the conditions of the challenge.
3. **Selection**: Candidates are selected for reproduction based on their fitness scores.
4. **Crossover**: Selected candidates undergo crossover to produce offspring that combine traits from both parents.
5. **Mutation**: Offspring are mutated to introduce new traits and increase diversity.
6. **Replacement/ Random Immigrant**: New offspring replace some of the older population.
7. **Termination**: The algorithm repeats until a candidate that fully solves Einstein's Challenge is found or a set number of generations have passed.

## Goals
The goal of this genetic algorithm is to efficiently navigate the vast search space of possible solutions to Einstein's Challenge and converge on the correct answer.

## Conclusion
By leveraging the principles of natural evolution, this genetic algorithm provides an innovative approach to solving Einstein's Challenge, demonstrating the versatility and power of evolutionary computation.
